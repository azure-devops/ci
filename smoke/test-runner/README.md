# Smoke Test Runner for Azure Jenkins Plugins

## Prerequisites

1. A Jenkins image build with the [Image Builder](../image-builder)
1. Azure Service Principal
1. A Jenkins instance with the following tools / support:
   * Azure Credentials plugin, with the service principal configured
   * Git
   * Azure CLI.
   * Docker. The user running Jenkins process should have permission to build and run docker images.

## How to Test

1. Add Azure service principal credential to the Jenkins instance.
2. Create a new freestyle job
    * SCM: Clone the smoke test code from the Git repository
    * Tick the "Use secret text(s) or file(s)" option, specify the service principal credentials created above,
       with all the variable names unchanged.
    * Add an "Execute shell" build step, with the following code

       ```
       cd smoke/test-runner
       perl perl/jenkins-smoke-test.pl --help
       perl perl/jenkins-smoke-test.pl --image <jenkins-image-name>
       ```

    * Add a post-build action "Archive the artifacts" with the following pattern:

       ```
       smoke/test-runner/.artifacts/*
       ```

## Extra Options

* To test with existing Azure resources, check the following two options:
   * `--suffix`: this is the common name suffix for all the generated resources. If provided
      from command line, the resource name will be constructed with this suffix. And if
      the resource already exists, it will be reused. This will be helpful to run the tests
      multiple times with the same suffix.
   * `--noclean`: by default, the script deletes all the resource groups created during the
      tests, if this option is specified, the resources will be left untouched, and can be
      reused afterwards, with the same `--suffix` option provided.

   If you already has all the resource provisioned outside of this script, you can specify
   the information of the resources from command line, again, the script will reuse the
   resource if it already exists. Check the [Full Command Line Options](#full-command-line-options)
   for all the resource options.

* To add some hosts to the K8s network security group to allow them to access the master host via SSH:
   * `--nsgAllowHost` - comma separated hosts that needs to be added the NSG allow list

## Full Command Line Options

```

       --tenantId|-t                Tenant ID

       --image|-i                   The Jenkins image used to run the tests

     <Optional>
       --location                   The resource location for all the resources, default "Southeast Asia"
       --adminUser                  The user name to login to ACS cluster master or other VM
       --publicKeyFile              The public key file used to create ACS cluster or other VM resources

       --suffix                     The name suffix for all the related resources and groups. This will be
                                    used to generate the default value for all the followed resource group names
                                    and the resource names. If not specified, a random one will be generated.
                                    For each of the related resource, the script will check if it exists and
                                    provision the resource if absent.

## How to Write Test Cases

To write test cases for the Azure Jenkins plugins, add configuration files in:

* `smoke/test-runner/jobs`: XML configurations to define the job, which can be copied out from
   `$JENKINS_HOME/jobs/<job-name>/config.xml`. Rename the config file to `<job-name>.xml`. They
   will be processed before the Jenkins process is started, so **the `$$<option>$$` segment
   will be replaced with the corresponding option from the start up Perl script**.
*  If the job depends on some external data source, for example, the web application source code,
   the Kubernetes deployment YAML files, or any files that's needed during the job run, you may:

   * Fetch the source from external SCM
   * Add an `Execute Shell` build step to generate the source files (or the `sh` command in pipeline).
      This is preferred as it does not have external source code dependency.

   As long as it is in the job XML definition, it will be processed by the `$$<option>$$` replacement
   and you can generate the job definition dynamically.
